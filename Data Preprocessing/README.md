The Data-Preprocessing section showcases common data pre processing techniques that have been used on a basic .csv dataset. 
The following steps have been performed in this section:
 1) Importing the dataset and selecting the dependent & independent variables
 2) Taking care of missing data 
 3) Encoding categorical data 
 4) Splitting the data into a training and test set 
 5) Feature scaling so that some features are not dominant
